*Exercise 1.4:* Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.  Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src racket :lang sicp
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

(a-plus-abs-b 1 -15)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

If ~b~ is greater than ~0~, add ~a~ and ~b~.
If ~b~ is a negative number, negate it, i.e.,:

#+begin_src racket :lang sicp
(- -15)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 15

and /then/ add ~a~ and ~b~ (which is now ~(- b)~ (which is the absolute value of ~b~)) together.

In other words, this is making use of unary operators.

*Exercise 1.5:* Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation.  He defines the following two procedures:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src racket :eval no :lang sicp
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

;; Then he evaluates the expression

(test 0 (p))
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation?

What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation?

Explain your answer.  (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form `if' is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)
#+end_quote


Applicative-order evaluation: ~(test 0 (p))~ makes it hang / get stuck in a loop as ~(p)~ gets eternally deferred.

A normal order-evaluator would do this instead:

#+begin_src racket :lang sicp
(test 0 (p))

(if (= 0 0)
     0
     (p))

(if #t
     0
     (p))
0

*Exercise 1.6:* Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why `if' needs to be provided as a special form.  "Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond'?" she asks.  Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of `if':
#+end_quote

#+begin_src racket :lang sicp
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src racket :lang sicp
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5
: 0

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if' to rewrite the square-root program:

#+begin_src racket :lang sicp
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
#+end_src

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square
roots?  Explain.

It creates an infinite loop. Any function supplied to new-if will be applied, sqrt-iter
then loops forever after.

*Exercise 1.7:* The `good-enough?' test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers.  Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision.  This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers.  Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers.  An alternative strategy for implementing `good-enough?' is to watch how `guess' changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess.  Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test.  Does this work better for small and large numbers?

The Berkeley series of lectures over the SICP (as recorded from a 2010 webclass) has the professor there noting on this section and more or less stating that this is much less important "these days" (2010) and that, for the most part, one can get by without having to worry too much about these efficiencies when said worry isn't warranted. Id est, someone programming complex, cutting edge live-rendered 3D graphics for a video game /will/ want to worry about making their code more efficient in order to keep up the phantasmagoria, whereas someone modeling a logic system probably won't have to worry about such things.

e.g., the 'else' statement
is the only one to be true here
as x = 1 \therefore x \neq 0,

Using calculus we can rewrite and simplify that as g(n)=2^n
